How to use bitmap fonts
------
This can use bitmap fonts exported by the program fontbuilder. (https://github.com/andryblack/fontbuilder)
Export the description in the "simple" format and the image as a PNG. The filename of the PNG is stored in the description, so don't change it.
When loading the font with the loadFont function, pass the filename for the description file.
